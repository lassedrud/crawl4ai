# Crawl4AI

Welcome to the official documentation for Crawl4AI! üï∑Ô∏èü§ñ Crawl4AI is an open-source Python library designed to simplify web crawling and extract useful information from web pages. This documentation will guide you through the features, usage, and customization of Crawl4AI.

## Introduction

Crawl4AI has one clear task: to make crawling and data extraction from web pages easy and efficient, especially for large language models (LLMs) and AI applications. Whether you are using it as a REST API or a Python library, Crawl4AI offers a robust and flexible solution with full asynchronous support.

## Quick Start

Here's a quick example to show you how easy it is to use Crawl4AI with its new asynchronous capabilities:

```python
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler

async def main():
    # Create an instance of AsyncWebCrawler
    async with AsyncWebCrawler(verbose=True) as crawler:
        # Run the crawler on a URL
        result = await crawler.arun(url="https://www.nbcnews.com/business")

        # Print the extracted content
        print(result.markdown)

# Run the async main function
asyncio.run(main())
```

### Explanation

1. **Importing the Library**: We start by importing the `AsyncWebCrawler` class from the `crawl4ai` library and the `asyncio` module.
2. **Creating an Async Context**: We use an async context manager to create an instance of `AsyncWebCrawler`.
3. **Running the Crawler**: The `arun()` method is used to asynchronously crawl the specified URL and extract meaningful content.
4. **Printing the Result**: The extracted content is printed, showcasing the data extracted from the web page.
5. **Running the Async Function**: We use `asyncio.run()` to execute our async main function.
