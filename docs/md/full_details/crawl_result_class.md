# Crawl Result

The `CrawlResult` class is the heart of Crawl4AI's output, encapsulating all the data extracted from a crawling session. This class contains various fields that store the results of the web crawling and extraction process. Let's break down each field and see what it holds. ðŸŽ‰

## Class Definition

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import Dict, List, Optional

class CrawlResult(BaseModel):
    url: str
    html: str
    success: bool
    cleaned_html: Optional[str] = None
    media: Dict[str, List[Dict]] = {}
    links: Dict[str, List[Dict]] = {}
    screenshot: Optional[str] = None
    markdown: Optional[str] = None
    extracted_content: Optional[str] = None
    metadata: Optional[dict] = None
    error_message: Optional[str] = None
    session_id: Optional[str] = None
    responser_headers: Optional[dict] = None
    status_code: Optional[int] = None
```

## Fields Explanation

### `url: str`
The URL that was crawled. This field simply stores the URL of the web page that was processed.

### `html: str`
The raw HTML content of the web page. This is the unprocessed HTML source as retrieved by the crawler.

### `success: bool`
A flag indicating whether the crawling and extraction were successful. If any error occurs during the process, this will be `False`.

### `cleaned_html: Optional[str]`
The cleaned HTML content of the web page. This field holds the HTML after removing unwanted tags like `<script>`, `<style>`, and others that do not contribute to the useful content.

### `media: Dict[str, List[Dict]]`
A dictionary containing lists of extracted media elements from the web page. The media elements are categorized into images, videos, and audios. Here's how they are structured:

- **Images**: Each image is represented as a dictionary with `src` (source URL) and `alt` (alternate text).
- **Videos**: Each video is represented similarly with `src` and `alt`.
- **Audios**: Each audio is represented with `src` and `alt`.

```python
media = {
    'images': [
        {'src': 'image_url1', 'alt': 'description1', "type": "image"},
        {'src': 'image_url2', 'alt': 'description2', "type": "image"}
    ],
    'videos': [
        {'src': 'video_url1', 'alt': 'description1', "type": "video"}
    ],
    'audios': [
        {'src': 'audio_url1', 'alt': 'description1', "type": "audio"}
    ]
}
```

### `links: Dict[str, List[Dict]]`
A dictionary containing lists of internal and external links extracted from the web page. Each link is represented as a dictionary with `href` (URL) and `text` (link text).

- **Internal Links**: Links pointing to the same domain.
- **External Links**: Links pointing to different domains.

```python
links = {
    'internal': [
        {'href': 'internal_link1', 'text': 'link_text1'},
        {'href': 'internal_link2', 'text': 'link_text2'}
    ],
    'external': [
        {'href': 'external_link1', 'text': 'link_text1'}
    ]
}
```

### `screenshot: Optional[str]`
A base64-encoded screenshot of the web page. This field stores the screenshot data if the crawling was configured to take a screenshot.

### `markdown: Optional[str]`
The content of the web page converted to Markdown format. This is useful for generating clean, readable text that retains the structure of the original HTML.

### `extracted_content: Optional[str]`
The content extracted based on the specified extraction strategy. This field holds the meaningful content blocks extracted from the web page, ready for your AI and data processing needs.

### `metadata: Optional[dict]`
A dictionary containing metadata extracted from the web page, such as title, description, keywords, and other meta tags.

### `error_message: Optional[str]`
If an error occurs during crawling, this field will contain the error message, helping you debug and understand what went wrong. ðŸš¨

### `session_id: Optional[str]`
A unique identifier for the crawling session. This can be useful for tracking and managing multiple crawling sessions.

### `responser_headers: Optional[dict]`
A dictionary containing the response headers from the web server. This can provide additional information about the server and the response.

### `status_code: Optional[int]`
The HTTP status code of the response. This indicates the success or failure of the HTTP request (e.g., 200 for success, 404 for not found, etc.).
