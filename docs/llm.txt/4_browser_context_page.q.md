4. **Identity Preservation**
   - *"How can I simulate human-like behavior (mouse movements, scrolling) to preserve identity?"*
   - *"What techniques does `crawl4ai` use to bypass CAPTCHA challenges and maintain authenticity?"*
   - *"How do I use real user profiles to solve CAPTCHAs and save session data?"*

5. **Session Management**
   - *"How can I maintain state across multiple crawls using `session_id`?"*
   - *"What are best practices for using sessions to handle multi-step login flows?"*
   - *"How do I reuse sessions for authenticated workflows and reduce overhead?"*

6. **Dynamic Content Handling**
   - *"How can I inject JavaScript or wait conditions to ensure dynamic elements load before extraction?"*
   - *"What strategies can I use to navigate infinite scrolling or ‘Load More’ buttons?"*

7. **Scaling and Performance**
   - *"How do I scale crawls to handle thousands of URLs concurrently?"*
   - *"What options exist for caching and resource utilization optimization?"*
   - *"How do I handle multiple browser instances efficiently for high-volume crawling?"*

8. **Extraction Strategies**
   - *"How can I use `JsonCssExtractionStrategy` to extract structured data?"*
   - *"What methods are available to chunk or filter extracted content?"*

9. **Magic Mode vs. Managed Browsers**
   - *"What is Magic Mode and when should I use it over Managed Browsers?"*
   - *"Does Magic Mode help with basic sites, and how do I enable it?"*

10. **Troubleshooting and Best Practices**
    - *"How can I debug browser automation issues with logs and headful mode?"*
    - *"What best practices should I follow to respect website policies?"*
    - *"How do I handle authentication flows, form submissions, and CAPTCHA challenges effectively?"*
