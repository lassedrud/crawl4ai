### Hypothetical Questions

1. **General Understanding of the New Caching System**
   - *"Why did Crawl4AI move from boolean cache flags to a `CacheMode` enum?"*
   - *"What are the benefits of using a single `CacheMode` enum over multiple booleans?"*

2. **CacheMode Usage**
   - *"What `CacheMode` should I use if I want normal caching (both read and write)?"*
   - *"How do I enable a mode that only reads from cache, or only writes to cache?"*
   - *"What does `CacheMode.BYPASS` do, and how is it different from `CacheMode.DISABLED`?"*

3. **Migrating from Old to New System**
   - *"How do I translate `bypass_cache=True` to the new `CacheMode` approach?"*
   - *"I used to set `disable_cache=True`; what `CacheMode` should I use now?"*
   - *"If I previously used `no_cache_read=True`, how do I achieve the same effect with `CacheMode`?"*

4. **Implementation Details**
   - *"How do I specify the `CacheMode` in my crawler runs?"*
   - *"Can I pass the `CacheMode` to `arun` directly, or do I need a `CrawlerRunConfig` object?"*

5. **Suppressing Deprecation Warnings**
   - *"How can I temporarily disable deprecation warnings while I migrate my code?"*

6. **Edge Cases and Best Practices**
   - *"What if I forget to update my code and still use the old flags?"*
   - *"Is there a `CacheMode` for scenarios where I want to only write to cache and never read old data?"*

7. **Examples and Code Snippets**
   - *"Can I see a side-by-side comparison of old and new caching code for a given URL?"*
   - *"How can I confirm that using `CacheMode.BYPASS` skips both reading and writing cache?"*

8. **Performance and Reliability**
   - *"Will switching to `CacheMode` improve my code’s readability and reduce confusion?"*
   - *"Can the new caching system still handle large-scale crawling scenarios efficiently?"*

### Topics Discussed in the File

- **Old vs. New Caching Approach**:  
  Previously, multiple boolean flags (`bypass_cache`, `disable_cache`, `no_cache_read`, `no_cache_write`) controlled caching. Now, a single `CacheMode` enum simplifies configuration.

- **CacheMode Enum**:  
  Provides clear modes:
  - `ENABLED`: Normal caching (read and write)
  - `DISABLED`: No caching at all
  - `READ_ONLY`: Only read from cache, don’t write new data
  - `WRITE_ONLY`: Only write to cache, don’t read old data
  - `BYPASS`: Skip cache entirely for this operation

- **Migration Patterns**:  
  A simple mapping table helps developers switch old boolean flags to the corresponding `CacheMode` value.

- **Suppressing Deprecation Warnings**:  
  Temporarily disabling deprecation warnings provides a grace period to update old code.

- **Code Examples**:  
  Side-by-side comparisons show how to update code from old flags to the new `CacheMode` approach.

In summary, the file guides developers in transitioning from the old caching boolean flags to the new `CacheMode` enum, explaining the rationale, providing a mapping table, and offering code snippets to facilitate a smooth migration.
