## My Personal Journey

Iâ€™ve always loved exploring the web development, back from when HTML and JavaScript were hardly intertwined. My curiosity drove me into web development, mathematics, AI, and machine learning, always keeping a close tie to real industrial applications. In 2009â€“2010, as a postgraduate student, I created platforms to gather and organize published papers for Masterâ€™s and PhD researchers. Faced with post-grad studentsâ€™ data challenges, I built a helper app to crawl newly published papers and public data. Relying on Internet Explorer and DLL hacks was far more cumbersome than modern tools, highlighting my longtime background in data extraction.

Fast-forward to 2023: I needed to fetch web data and transform it into neat **markdown** for my AI pipeline. All solutions I found were either **closed-source**, overpriced, or produced low-quality output. As someone who has built large edu-tech ventures (like KidoCode), I believe **data belongs to the people**. We shouldnâ€™t pay $16 just to parse the webâ€™s publicly available content. This friction led me to create my own library, **Crawl4AI**, in a matter of days to meet my immediate needs. Unexpectedly, it went **viral**, accumulating thousands of GitHub stars.

Now, in **January 2025**, Crawl4AI has surpassed **21,000 stars** and remains the #1 trending repository. Itâ€™s my way of giving back to the community after benefiting from open source for years. Iâ€™m thrilled by how many of you share that passion. Thank you for being here, join our Discord, file issues, submit PRs, or just spread the word. Letâ€™s build the best data extraction, crawling, and scraping library **together**.

## What Does Crawl4AI Do?

Crawl4AI is a feature-rich crawler and scraper that aims to:

1.â€€**Generate Clean Markdown**: Perfect for RAG pipelines or direct ingestion into LLMs.  
2.â€€**Structured Extraction**: Parse repeated patterns with CSS, XPath, or LLM-based extraction.  
3.â€€**Advanced Browser Control**: Hooks, proxies, stealth modes, session re-useâ€”fine-grained control.  
4.â€€**High Performance**: Parallel crawling, chunk-based extraction, real-time use cases.  
5.â€€**Open Source**: No forced API keys, no paywallsâ€”everyone can access their data.  

**Core Philosophies**:
- **Democratize Data**: Free to use, transparent, and highly configurable.  
- **LLM Friendly**: Minimally processed, well-structured text, images, and metadata, so AI models can easily consume it.

- **Advanced**  
  Explore link & media handling, lazy loading, hooking & authentication, proxies, session management, and more.  
- **Extraction**  
  Detailed references for no-LLM (CSS, XPath) vs. LLM-based strategies, chunking, and clustering approaches.  
- **API Reference**  
  Find the technical specifics of each class and method, including `AsyncWebCrawler`, `arun()`, and `CrawlResult`.

Throughout these sections, youâ€™ll find code samples you can **copy-paste** into your environment. If something is missing or unclear, raise an issue or PR.
