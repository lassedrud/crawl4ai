chunking_overview: Chunking strategies divide large texts into manageable parts for content processing and extraction | text segmentation, content division, document splitting | None
cosine_similarity_integration: Chunking prepares text segments for semantic similarity analysis using cosine similarity | semantic search, relevance matching | from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
rag_integration: Chunks can be integrated into RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems for structured workflows | retrieval augmented generation, RAG pipeline | None
regex_chunking: Split text using regular expression patterns for basic segmentation | regex splitting, pattern-based chunking | RegexChunking(patterns=[r'\n\n'])
sentence_chunking: Divide text into individual sentences using NLP tools | sentence tokenization, NLP chunking | from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize
topic_chunking: Create topic-coherent chunks using TextTiling algorithm | topic segmentation, TextTiling | from nltk.tokenize import TextTilingTokenizer
fixed_length_chunking: Segment text into chunks with fixed word count | word-based chunking, fixed size segments | FixedLengthWordChunking(chunk_size=100)
